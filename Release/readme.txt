Fixes:
Fixed bug where ce would crash(close) on XP systems on certain type of games when openeing a process
Fixed the error at "Same as first scan" when using the float type
Pointer rescan for value now accepts more than 8 characters
Fixed pointerscan for value not supporting more than 1 thread
Fixed showing the fpu in the kernelmode debugger
Fixed Decreased/Increased by %
Dissect Data now detects non-exact floating point values again
Disabled executing the aobscan when assigning a script to the table
Some disassembler fixes
Again some more DPI fixes
The byte-editor in the hexeditor window is now properly aligned at the proper height
The XMM registers are now shown for kernelmode debugging as well
Implemented the stop button for kernelmode "Find what addresses this code accesses"
Fixed error message when pressing enter and no address is selected in the addresslist
Fixed samememory regions so the last byte is now included as well
Fixed the simple-copy/paste option in settings (it now has effect)
Fixed bug where pressing alt made a lot of controls invisible in vista and later
Fixed the pointerscan bug that caused out of memory problems for the scan (Was already secretly fixed and released for 5.6 one week after the official release, but still mentioning it)



Changes:
Rightclicking on registers(multiple locations) saves them to the clipboard
The values of dissect data can now be saved to disk
Auto Assembler script entries have a small <script> text you can click for easier script editing
The commonmodulelist.txt has been updated with some extra dll's that have nothing to do with the game (thanks to psych)
AutoAssembler: You can't move the cursor beyond the end of a line anymore
Pointerscan: Pointerscanner now tells you that pressing stop is a stupid thing to do
Pointerscan: doubleclicking an pointer with invalid base now adds it anyhow. (In case the base becomes valid again later)
Several extra window positions are now saved when the option to save the position is enabled (included pointerscan and autoassembler)
CE now notifies you if it thinks there's not enough dispace left
Default pointer option is now set back to insert instead of append
Added a "Same as first scan" hotkey option
When opening a new process and chosing to disable everything now also disables entries in advanced options
